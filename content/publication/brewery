abstract: "Motivation

Protein Structural Annotations are essential abstractions to deal with the prediction of Protein Structures. Many increasingly sophisticated Protein Structural Annotations have been devised in the last few decades. However the need for annotations that are easy to compute, process and predict has not diminished. This is especially true for protein structures that are hardest to predict such as novel folds.
Results

We propose Brewery, a suite of ab initio predictors of 1D Protein Structural Annotations. Brewery uses multiple sources of evolutionary information to achieve state-of-the-art predictions of Secondary Structure, Structural Motifs, Relative Solvent Accessibility and Contact Density.
Availability

The web server, standalone program, Docker image and training sets of Brewery are available at http://distilldeep.ucd.ie/brewery/."
