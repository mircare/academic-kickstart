Mirko Torrisi is a PhD Candidate at the School of Computer Science at University College Dublin, Ireland. He is advised by Dr. Gianluca Pollastri for his PhD project about Predicting Protein Structural Annotations by Deep and Shallow Learning. His research interests include Protein Structure Prediction, and Omics applications more broadly. He is attracted by the potential of Machine Learning and Deep Learning to make sense of large omics data to further expand human knowledge.
