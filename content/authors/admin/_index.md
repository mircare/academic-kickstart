I am a deep learning researcher at OpenChip in Barcelona, Spain. Previously, I focused on characterizing molecular interactions, and omics data at Bristol Myers Squibb through the application of deep learning techniques. I am deeply fascinated by the potential of representation learning to decipher the continually expanding omics data, thereby advancing our understanding of human knowledge.

During my PhD with Dr. Gianluca Pollastri, I focused on *Predicting Protein Structural Annotations by Deep and Shallow Learning* at University College Dublin, Ireland. I visited Dr. Pierre Baldi's lab at the University of California, Irvine in 2018. I hold a BSc in Informatics with the highest honour from Università degli Studi di Catania, Italy.

Beyond my research endeavours, I am also passionate about topics related to sustainability, and enjoy hiking, snowboarding, and cycling.
